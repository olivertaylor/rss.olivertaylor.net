				<div class="description">Yet-still-sheltered but wanna-be-walking folk — My friends made a wonderful printed thing. It’s called NJP#1: Shōwa Tokyo and it offers you a glimpse into Tokyo circa 1926 - 1989. A big chunk of what emerged in that period is, obviously, still part of the city. So to spend time in Shōwa is to better understand Tokyo today.
The printed thing vibrates between magazine and book — it’s vaguely magazine shaped, but the driving ethos is firmly book-leaning.</div>
