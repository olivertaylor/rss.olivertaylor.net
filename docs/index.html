				<div class="description"><p><i>Last week I spoke with Sara Huddleston, candidate for Iowa state house in district 11 (Storm Lake). A longtime community organizer and three-term city council member, she was the first Latina elected to a city council in the state of Iowa, and would be the first Latina to serve in the state house. She was recently named to Joe Biden's Iowa Latino Steering Committee.

<p>The last time Sara ran, she did so on a shoestring budget. This year, we're supporting Sara and several of her fellow candidates in Iowa and Arizona through a fundraising effort called the <a href="https://techsolidarity.org/resources/state_slate.html">State Slate</a>. The Iowa state house race is one of the closest in the country—we need to win four seats to break the Republican trifecta. If you enjoy this interview, I hope you will <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/state_slate_2">contribute to the State Slate</a>!</p>


<p>At several points in our conversation, we refer to “J.D.”—this is J.D. Scholten, the candidate for Congress in the district that includes Storm Lake. I did <a href="https://idlewords.com/2020/04/j.d._scholten_on_coronavirus_in_iowa.htm">a similar interview</a> with him back in April, which I encourage you to read next!</i></p>

<p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/huddleston.jpg" />

<p><b>I'm delighted to meet you. Please, tell us about yourself and your race!</b></p>

<p>First of all, I really appreciate what you guys are doing. We've been getting a lot of contributions which is really appreciated and needed. You're right—especially in rural areas like Iowa, raising money and then getting people to participate is hard. You have to work hard to get to people here. 

<p>I was telling J.D. that one of the things we need to mobilize the Latino vote. I don't know how much you know about me but four years ago I ran for the first time.  And we were pretty close, about 3,000 votes short of getting elected. During that time we raised the number of registered Democrats by 10%.  I was working to get people registered to vote. 

<p>I'm always a strong advocate for exercising your rights. So we were registering them to vote, get absentee ballots, and figure out the place they needed to go. I was out there on the football field, soccer field, the baseball field, church—whatever it was, wherever I needed to be and we increased registration by 10%.

<p>This is my second time trying.  I was on City Council for 12 years, serving three terms as the first Latina elected to City Council in the whole state of Iowa.  With the highest votes which nobody has been able to beat that number. And you have to understand, this was in 2004. 

<p>I was born in Mexico, moved here 30 years ago, married my husband Mac who is from the United States—he's from the East Coast—and three years after I got my citizenship I decided to run for city council. And we made it!

<p>I've done a lot here. I've been involved in so many boards, both at the City Council level and the state level.  I sit on the magistrates commission and on the airport commission. This time I decided to run because, like you say, there are so many issues. People are upset because nothing is happening. Things are getting worse and somebody’s got to do something. Somebody's got to step up and help.

<p>And so I decided, why not. Let's do it, let’s try to do something. I called J.D. and said “Hey, we're going to get this done. I'm going to help you, we're going to get it done and I'm going to get more votes and do whatever I can.”

<p>People already know me, I represent two counties. Buena Vista and Sac County, seventeen towns in total. Four years ago I door knocked each town—all seventeen towns. So people are familiar now with my face. I got to door knock in Republican houses and Democrats, whoever was out there, just to get my name and my face out there, for people to get to know me. 

<p>When politicians campaign, many times they don't go to little towns and interact with people. Based on my own feelings, I thought that if I had to choose one of these candidates, I would really like to know “who is Sara Huddleston, what is she running for?” So that’s what I did.  Now, of course, everything is different with covid.  You can't do much, everything is online, calling, phone calls.

<p><b>You must spend your life on Zoom now</b></p>

Yes, lots. All my meetings, all my trainings—Zoom.  This time I'm getting a lot of things through Zoom. Of course we have a Facebook page, emails, that kind of stuff.  If not for covid, we would be doing something else, but we can’t do that. We can’t be close to people.

<p><b>It's frustrating because in the state races I know you can actually meet most of your voters, if you put in the work.</b></p>

<p>Yeah, oh yes. 

<p><b>For people who've never been to Western Iowa, can you describe Storm Lake, what the community is like and what life is like out in the western half of the state?</b></p>

<p>I call Storm Lake the little oasis in the middle of nowhere. We are in a very rural area. I would say we have about 14 to 15,000 people in this town. We have a meat plant, Tyson, and we have an industrial area. We have Rembrandt, which focuses on chickens, and about 45 minutes from here there’s another meat plant. There’s a university, and a high school. It’s a very, very nice town. And of course it has a lake—a lovely green area right out in the middle of nowhere.

<p>In Buena Vista county, we have a high number of Democrats. Sac County is where we have the Republicans. But you never know. We have a majority Republican, some Democrats, and in the middle a big number of independents and people with no party affiliation. That’s a big number that you can grab. We have pretty much everything—these towns are very nice. Even though we are far away from everything, we have everything. There’s a hospital, clinics, tourism—it’s a very nice town.

<p>When I was on city council, we created a hotel, which generates a lot of revenue for the city and is becoming the best spot in the area. Everybody goes to this hotel to enjoy the lakefront park. 

<p>The community here in Storm Lake is very diverse. There are something like 40 languages spoken at the high school. The Latino population keeps increasing. The latest arrivals are the Cubans, we had a lot of Cubans moving in, Mexicans, Salvadorans, you name it.

<p><b>What brings Cubans out to Iowa?</b></p>

<p>The meat plant! they're all working at this meat plant! The meat plants and other agricultural industries that we have around.  And the pay is good, that's one thing. 

<p>If you compare the salary of what you make—for instance, I know one Cuban who was working at the airport in Miami, they make double that salary now in the meat plant. So they move here. Once moved, they bring their families. It has increased a lot; we’ve had a lot of Cubans lately. 

<p><b>J.D. told me a bit about the meat plants. First off, they’re huge, they employ thousands of people. Is that mostly immigrant labor?</b></p>

<p>I would say so, I would say so. It's mostly immigrant labor in Storm Lake, Iowa. Asians, Latinos, a few African-Americans from Chicago, they’ve moved here. These towns are very nice, especially if you want to have a family. You feel safe—they are safe towns for families, for kids. That's one of the things that you find out from people who want to settle down here.  You have young people who at their age are going to come see and go back to the cities where they come from, but people who want to establish a family, they stay. That's been very good for the community.

<p>The meat plants—that’s definitely the job where they work. We have a lot of people too working for the schools, the hospital. 

<p><b>One of the things I learned from J.D. early on is there’s very low unemployment in Northwest Iowa. But when you listen to [incumbent IA-4 Congressman] Steve King, his message was always "these people are pouring over the border, invading our country”. He had all this anti-immigrant rhetoric, but at the same time, the economy where you are is heavily dependent on immigrant and migrant labor. Not just the meat plants, but all of agriculture. </b></p>

<p>Exactly.

<p><b>So how do white farmers in Iowa balance this in their head between "I don't want my country invaded by foreigners" and “I really need them to do all the work”?</b></p>

<p>I don't know. This is from my own experience. I worked for the domestic abuse and sexual assault agency for 14 years. And during that time I worked with a lot of battered immigrant women. We’d deal with immigration, I was trying to help with immigration , especially applying for citizenship or any legal status through VAWA (the Violence Against Women Act). 

<p>One of the things that we started noticing is that starting in 1996 a big wave of immigrants started coming. But you're right, what is all this rhetoric with King? My personal point of view is that he used that a lot for political purposes, to get elected.  

<p>But it’s a two-way street. The farmers-yes, you have a lot of immigrants moving here. And more and more each year, they're getting legalized, gaining some kind of legal status—either a work permit, a legal permanent resident, or U.S. citizenship. 

<p>But you need them, especially in these meat plants. This area is 100% agriculture. Farmers bring their animal stock here. Both groups need each other.  And more and more, I've been noticing there are immigrants working on the farms, especially the dairy farms, working with hogs, or building buildings on the farms. 

<p>I have a few farmer friends who say that they need immigrants, because who else is going to do this kind of job? If they weren’t needed, they wouldn’t be moving here. And every year you see at least two or three new families in town. 

<p>My personal point of view is that Steve King uses a lot of that for himself, for his political campaign. People love him when they hear something like that.

<p><b>But why does it work so well? I can understand it working in a place that’s economically depressed, but a place where you struggle to find farm hands, and at the same time you’re attacking immigrants and people still vote for you. I guess I just don’t understand why it was so effective. </b></p>

<p>Let me tell you, when I ran the first time for city council, this town used to have more caucasian people here.  And I thought “who is going to elect me?” When I ran, there were six people, three seats, two re-elected and one practically open. There were six candidates for these seats. I couldn’t believe that they voted for me. I thought "who's going to vote for me?”  All these people [running] had money, they were businessmen, bankers, they were well known.  But I heard a lot of people tell me we needed to have a Latino person run to represent that community and have a voice, and I thought, that’s true. And we made it.

<p>I think all these contradictions—if we didn’t have people here, these towns would die. They would die because what are they going to do? You look at the meat plants today, about 90% of the workforce is immigrants. the high school is 75% or more immigrants, Latinos and every other culture, in the high school. Can you imagine the impact if something happened? Would they close the plants? The schools depend on them, the farmers depend on them, everybody—the economy would collapse.

<p>And I don't think this town is going to die soon. In fact, it’s growing more.

<p><b>You’ve been working hard to mobilize the Latino vote. Why are levels of voting so low among the Hispanic community in rural places? </b></p>

<p>I believe there's a lot of barriers. Even though they become naturalized US citizens, especially when they’re older foks—you know you can have the naturalization test in your own language when you’re a certain age—the language barrier is real. There needs to be more education, more information on your voting rights. In other countries, and especially in Latin American countries, politics are very corrupt. Many of the politicians do not get that close to citizens. They do not go and shake hands. Only when they're going to do the campaign at the very last minute.

<p>When people come here and become citizens, they don’t know the way politics works. The way that I see it, the vote is your voice. If you want something to change, if you want something to happen, you have to exercise that voice, you have to get out and vote. That's the only way something is going to move, something is going to happen. 

<p>So one of the things I always do is inform, educate about the meaning of the vote, and what your participation means for the community. That is the main reason.

<p>But there’s also other reasons. When they do elections, it usually happens on a weekday. I can't speak for the rest of the nation, but I  have an idea about here. People work at the meat plants from 8 to 5, 8 to 6.  November in Iowa is cold, there's snow, there might be ice. As you're getting out of work, it already looks like the middle of the night. It’s cold and dark, you go straight home. The last thing you want to do is get out and go to vote. You've got your kids, you've got to feed them, you've got to do this and that.  You only have a couple of hours because tomorrow, you have to wake up at four in the morning to prepare lunches for the family and then go back to work. 

<p>So when they get home and they have a window of time to go vote, they’re tired. The last thing they want to do is change and take a shower and go out to vote.

<p>Vote by mail will really help with this. Now, in the primaries, voting participation was high because people could send in absentee ballots. One of the reporters from the local newspaper told me they were very surprised because turnout was high for the primary election. 

<p><b>The absentee ballot also gives you more time for voter turnout, instead of getting everybody out on one day.</b></p>

<p>Exactly. So there’s a lot of barriers, the language, many times people don’t understand who they’re voting for. When I ran four years ago, I carried my calling card and other politician’s cards, because they didn’t know who was who. That was very interesting. When I was door knocking, I would ask “are you familiar with these guys?” Let’s say Steve King, I'd ask “have you heard of Steve King?”. And they say “oh yes we know him” but, but they've never seen his face or familiarized themselves with his platform. They only heard bad things about him, and then you show them the posters. “This is him, and this is the guy running against him.”

<p>There was a lot of education. I spent a lot of time educating people, especially the Latino community, about the election and about getting out to vote. But in the end, it raised Democratic registration in the district by 10%. 

<p>And it was a lot of work. I went to soccer fields, football fields, I stayed after church, I carried little postcards, I made little handouts to help familiarize people with voting. We had tables everywhere, even the meat plant at the time let me set up a table with no party affiliation, just information about voting, how to ask for an absentee ballot, how to participate.

<p>So that’s what I did. Now that I'm running again, people see me and say "you're running again, that's really good, I'm going to vote for you.”

<p><b>I went to a Bernie event in Storm Lake, and I also saw Mayor Pete event there. They both had amazing turnout, an overflow crowd. The Sanders campaign especially was working hard to organize the Latino vote for the caucuses. But I also know that the second the presidential primary is over in Iowa, they all leave. So I’m wondering if that has helped you, or if was just done for their campaigns.</b></p>

<p>You see that especially in Iowa, it's not just Storm Lake.  Presidential candidates when they run, they start here in Iowa with the caucuses. After it’s all over, that’s it. Nothing happens. That’s why I’m a true believer that not just for the presidential race or any specific election, that getting out to vote is a continuous education. It’s gotta be continuous, educating people. 

<p>Every time I find out that someone has become a US citizen, I try to educate and talk about voting. People need to be voting every year.  The Presidential candidates come here, say one thing, show up, and then leave. 

<p><b>Do they leave anything behind? Do they say “hey here’s some lists of people we signed up?” Is there any sort of transfer? Or do they just disappear over the horizon?</b></p>

<p>Everybody disappeared, practically. They only focus on Iowa during the time they are running. J.D. has been pretty persistent! He’s from Sioux City, so he’s about an hour from here. He’s always been there, moving and contacting people. 

<p>Because of coronavirus we haven't done any events, but last year he and I had events. We were having people everywhere.

<p>That’s what happens in these areas. 

<p>I’ll be honest with you, I’m glad you guys are doing this because seriously, to run for any position at this level, first of all you have to have guts. And second of all, you have to have a group of people that can support you, of volunteers. In this area, you have Democrats who keep quiet about it, “I’m a Democrat but shhh…” because most people are Republicans. 

<p>Once you are in Des Moines, it’s like this half of the state doesn’t exist. So we have to do it ourselves, work hard to get there. And yes, they pay attention here and there, but not as much as they do to candidates who are in Des Moines or on the other side of the state. 

<p>We have to prove that we’re working, that we have volunteers. Like I was saying to J.D., we have to work together, get things together, try to get as many people as we can to get out and vote, especially in the Latino community.

<p><b>Can you talk about the money side of things as a state candidate? You mentioned that you have to hire a team; how do you also go about fundraising during a pandemic?</b></p>

<p>We have to make phone calls. It’s called phone banking. You have to purchase the “VAN” [the Voter Action Network, a database sold by the Democratic Party], that’s the whole list of voters, all the information is there. You have to call them and ask them are they going to support you, are they willing to donate something. 

<p><b>How much does VAN cost you?</b></p>

<p>For a state representative at this level, we have to pay $1,200. 

<p><b>That’s a lot of money for a state race.</b></p>

<p>It is. You have a budget, you get an example of a budget. In my case, the sample budget was for $60,000 (laughs). And they kind of calculate how much you’re going to be spending for media, for signs, all that stuff costs money

<p>When I ran the first time, I did it all by myself. You had to have the money just to buy the minimum—let’s say signs. Signs cost a lot of money, and sometimes they tell you not to spend money on this or that. Say we don’t spend money on t-shirts, buttons—you stil lhave to have the money for radio, media, newspapers.

<p>And four years ago, before covid, you had to do all the parades! When you start counting parades in each county if you want to get your name out there, you have to spend money to go into those parades—your truck, somebody’s going to lend you a truck, carry your signs, buttons, stickers. Because people want that.

<p><b>Iowans are very spoiled politically, because they’re used to the big-spending national campaigns.</b></p>

<p>Yes! So it’s a lot. And I’ve done a lot of trainings. In my case, Emily’s List has one training, I’ve done a national democratic training committee that the state provided. This time because of Covid, we’re doing everything on Zoom.

<p>Fundraising is one of the trainings. You’re supposed to call your friends—you start with your friends, your family, then you start outreaching out there. Hopefully people believe in you, like you, and they give you money. That’s the main thing. 

<p>It’s a lot of work, and a lot of things. you have to prepare. That’s just the fundraising. Then there’s another period when you have to make phone calls, because it’s getting closer to the election. Then you’re trying to convince them to vote for you, talk them through the process of voting, do they need an absentee ballot… there’s tons of work to do. 

<p><b>If you’re talking to someone who’s not really following the election, what are the top issues you give them that you’re running on?</b></p>

<p>In my case, because a lot of people know me in the area, since I’ve been on City Council and other boards, I’m well known in this area. When I talk to a friend or somebody that knows me from the school, I’m going to be talking about the school since they want to hear about that. So education is very important.

<p>I'm also very aware that where I live is an agricultural area, and we need to include farmers. We talk about what are we going to be doing with agriculture, the economy, especially right now with covid, a lot of businesses are not having people coming and shopping.  I was just in downtown this morning and there were only a few cars. Some of the businesses may be closing or already closed because of covid. There is a big economic impact.

<p>We have education, health—that people can’t afford insurance. One of the reasons I decided to run this time was a personal issue. I have a daughter who goes to college right now, and she didn't have insurance for a year. I couldn't afford it and my husband couldn't afford it. We both had jobs, but if we put her on our insurance, it would have cost about $600/month. That’s a lot of money.

<p>We started looking at what they had to offer. She couldn't qualify for Medicaid. So we have to find ways to make this affordable. 

<p>We also talk about jobs, raising the minimum wage, environmental issues. Mostly it’s about health and education.

<p><b>I know that rural health care has beein in a crisis, and especially rural mental health. You see it driving through Iowa.  In the big cities, everything is hospitals and medical care, and in small towns, at most there’s an urgent care clinic. </b></p>

If you want specialist care or anything that has more resources, you have to go to Minnesota, Des Moines, or Omaha. Des Moines is the closest; Omaha is about two hours away. You’ve seen how rural we are.

<p><b>So you have your choice of long drives</b></p>

Once you pass Fort Dodge on Hwy 20, all this area is more isolated than the east part of Iowa. More fields, more corn, more soybeans. And the small towns *are* dying because there’ s not much going on in the little towns. Storm Lake is one of the strong communities in this area in regards to the economy. It’s still growing, people are still coming, the schools are full. 

<p><b>We mentioned it a couple of times already, but Covid is obviously having an impact. Back to school time is coming. Since the Latino community was disproportionately affected through the meat plants, I’m curious how that’s playing out right now?</b></p>

<p>One, it’s pretty scary, there is no plan. Teachers are going to go back and worry how are they going to deal with this. Families, especially here in Buena Vista county, where there are a high number of covid cases, I don’t know how they’re going to do it. People have died here.  But there’s no planning implemented right now for staying safe—there’s nothing.

<p>My daughter goes to college and she says three classes are going to be in person, and two classes online. But how are they going to do it? They don’t know yet. Will it be a few students at different hours?  They still don't know, but they're going to start school three weeks from now, in August. It’s very scary. 

<p><b>Anything else you’d like people to know about your race?</b></p>

<p>Here’s one thing that I have to say, and I’m really proud of this. If I win, and I have to win, I want to win, I will be the first Latina elected to the State House. We do not have representation at the state house level.

<p><b>Are you kidding me?</b></p>

<p>No Latinas at all. It would be the first time in history. I was already the first Latina elected to City Council in Iowa, we already made history here. We got that twice.

<p>I know we talk bad about Steve King, but let me tell you—I work with everybody. And I like to get things done. And I don’t like just to pretend. I’m very progressive, I help anyone I can—everyone who knows me will say “Sara helps”. 

<p>But something needs to happen. It’s very sad how we are right now. The economy is hurting everyone.  Education, you name it, every single area of the government. I would really be proud if you guys can continue to support me. I told JD: I’m going to work hard, we’re going to do something, but we need the fundraising to get things done. 

<p>And like I said, if I win, we will make history!

<p><b>Thank you so much for talking to me!</b></p>

				<div class="description"><p><i>Last week I spoke by video chat with Alyse Galvin, who is running for Congress in Alaska's sole, enormous Congressional district in a rematch against Don Young, the longest-serving member of Congress.  Young, who just turned 87, is a <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/article/debate-backstage-tension-flared-between-young-and-dunbar/2014/10/04/">notorious figure in state and national politics</a>. His initial response to the pandemic was to dismiss it as a "beer virus" and continue to hold in-person fundraisers in the state, and his refusal to participate.

<p> I asked Alyse about the rapidly changing political (and physical!) climate in Alaska and how it has affected her campaign and her broader outlook. Just like my similar <a href="https://idlewords.com/2020/04/j.d._scholten_on_coronavirus_in_iowa.htm">interview with J.D. Scholten in April</a>, our conversation covered topics I had no idea about, including the special role memories of the 1918 pandemic play in native communities, the continuing challenge of crisis care in this vast state, and Alyse's personal story of how caring public school teachers and community leaders helped her find respite from a turbulent home life, an experience that in turn colors her outlook on the importance of public education and compassionate policy in the lives of kids today.

<p>Full disclosure: I fundraise for Alyse's campaign and will <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/great_slate">ask you for money</a> at the end of this interview!</i></p>

<p><b>Thank you for talking with me today! I know there are multiple overlapping things you have to juggle right now. There is COVID-19 and the health impact, which fortunately hasn’t been as bad as we'd dreaded in Alaska. There’s the financial impact of the lockdown. We’re also heading into summer, which probably means another record-breaking summer of the climate impacts that Alaska has been exposed to for many years.  And to top it all off, you’ve had <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/why-alaskans-are-trying-to-recall-their-governor">the gubernatorial recall</a>, and all the drama around that. So I guess I’d start just by asking—how’s it going? How are you holding up?</b></p>

<p>As much as it is a very tough time for many in Alaska and in the nation, I personally am holding up really well because this is just the kind of puzzle that I like to put together. I appreciate how many different facets of leadership are necessary right now.  There are things that we all know to be true about government in general, and true about our  centuries-old system that is supposed to be so fair and equal and just for all, that we’ve known inherently aren’t quite right.  But this period has almost opened up the underbelly, if you will, of that system. We know where some of the challenges are that haven’t been addressed. Alaska is seeing it just like everywhere else in the nation.

<p>We see it with a different flavor, because we’re a different flavor state—we’re unique. We have a diversity here that perhaps others don’t know about. Not just the 231 federally recognized tribes, but also the fact that 3 of the top 5 most diverse high schools in the entire nation are in Alaska. We have seen great disparities not just with regard to health care, but also finance, climate—all of these things line up when we’re experiencing a world pandemic, in a way that puts it much more to the forefront. 

<p>For me to be able to take some of that information and help has been... I’m not kidding, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, our reaction was “this is so much bigger than a race. What can we do? What can I do? I don’t feel right just running the race like I did in 2018. I need to find a way to help disseminate information, gather experts.” Remember, what we were hearing from experts in the news, and leaders from our President on down, was confusing to people, and changing very quickly.

<p>What we did right away as a campaign was to start modeling what we thought would be good behavior. This is a time when we’re seeing more respect for science than ever. For us as a staff, that meant going to remote work immediately, well before others. Then we started thinking about how we could be helpers on a grander scale. 

<p>We knew that we already had lots of people connected to our campaign, people who had voted or volunteered. We knew that people were listening and watching, and so from the very beginning it was about health. What could we do to help people understand what that’s about? We held town halls about that. Then we moved to finance. Alaska fared worse than any other state when it came to receiving disaster loans. So we had some discussions about those lifelines that are out there for small business. It was important that we did that. 

<p>With regard to climate change, we haven’t really had discussions about that yet. Summer’s just starting. But there are communities here experiencing horrible climate impacts. Their homes are sinking into the water, and they’re still waiting on real money to help them move their communities, or help them fix their roads. There are real problems with frost heaves, things like that. 

<p>The last piece you asked about is the recall. I think I’ll just say that Alaska is very tumultuous right now. There are decisions our governor made economically that hurt us even before the pandemic. So far, the governor has been very responsive to his state health administrator, which has been great. We have Dr. Anne Zink who has been really informative and straight-up, science based only information. At least initially, the governor was really great. Since then, a little less so, but we’ll see where that goes. 

<p><b>To what extent is Alaska tourist dependent? How is that impacting people up there?</b></p>

<p>After we talked about health care in our town halls, the next thing was to think about how much our towns have become ghost towns, because everything is shut down. When it comes to tourism, that is a little better than 10% of our GDP.  We expected to have 2.2 million visitors this year, but when cruise ships were cancelled, that dropped by 1.2 million  fewer visitors overnight. That one decision, which was a responsible one, lost us over 1/2 of our tourism. 

<p>We expected that there might be some other travel coming in, but naturally that’s pretty tough. We had a quarantine, now we’ve switched it to testing. If you test negative before and then again after a few days, then you get to go somewhere, but not to the off-the-road communities. So some of the places you got to visit before [referring to a visit I made to Utqiagvik in 2018] would not be permissible or even appropriate to visit today. 

<p>We have a bit of history there. In the 1918 pandemic, Alaska lost entire communities. Folks are trying to be sensitive around that. It’s not just tourism, but also fisheries. Fishing is another big part of the summer economy, about $4-5B a year. Given that, the governor looked at all of the numbers on the wall and decided “we can’t lose that”. So he created a plan where he asked for anyone involved with fisheries processing, or on the boats, to come to the community and quarantine for two weeks before doing any work, and to have a plan for their staff to do the same.  

<p>What happened then was that boats would come up and do the testing, and 3/4 of them would test positive! They would then have to turn around and go back to Seattle, that was the case with one processing company. Since fisheries started, we’ve seen a large uptick which has brought our mayor in Anchorage, where the fishing crews typically quarantine, to ask for tighter restrictions. This is such a difficult puzzle to put together.

<p>Before fisheries began, we had about 300 covid cases, now we’re at 676. These numbers may seem small to those in other states, but we’ve lost 12 people, and that’s 12 lives with families and friends.

<p>You were asking about tourism—at this point we’re mostly encouraging people who live in the state to visit other parts of Alaska that they’ve never seen. Alaskans to visit Alaska! Our parks are full of local people; it’s great to see everyone outside. Now we’re trying to figure out what we can do with buses, things like that. In a state that’s twice the size of Texas, there’s a lot of getting around to do. 

<p><b>Is there tension because there is a relatively low case count, and 12 fatalities? The sacrifice is striking close to home, while the disease mostly isn’t. People are getting antsy a few months in. How do you see that playing out in Alaska? How do you keep people healthy but also not rebelling against safety measures?</b></p>

<p>For the most part, people are listening to experts. We’re really lucky to have the chief medical officer, <a href="https://twitter.com/annezinkmd">Anne Zink</a>, who has become a hero. And we flattened the curve, we did that really well until maybe one week ago. I think we didn’t celebrate it enough, so we could pat ourselves on the back and give ourselves that energy to keep going. If we could manage to appreciate how well we’ve done, if we could really internalize that, we would find a way to stick this out.  

<p>Right now what we’re appreciating is that small businesses are sacrificing in a big way. Anyone who works at home with kids is sacrificing. Our children—no one is speaking up for those kids right now. But in a way, there will be sacrifices and we will need to figure out a way to make it up to them. If we figure out a way to tweak things a little bit, we can get them up to speed and then some—and then some because now they have had a different opportunity to appreciate so many things. Time, and relationships with real people, and lots more processing through something that wasn’t expected, almost what I would call a stress, but a stress that gives them something to learn from. 

<p>We need to reimagine our economy, so we keep anyone who’s providing goods or services safe in doing it. Our education system and health care system will need to do the same. Maybe we’re looking at the way we handle other issues that we never even thought of—the whole economy, including things around immigration, climate. Now we’re open to change. 

<p>It’s fascinating how many people are talking about science. As much as we’re super struggling, I see this as an opportunity to think about what that puzzle’s going to look like in our reimagined policy design for the post-pandemic era.
 
<p><b>How has the Federal response looked, from your perspective? I understand that your opponent has not been at the forefront of that response. But what do Alaskans think about how the government has handled this nationally?</b></p>

<p>I don’t know every state, but I can tell you this: it sure felt like the smaller the community, the more we saw leadership. So from the grass roots up is where we’ve seen a coordinated effort, in Alaska certainly. Our mayors and our village leaders, those are the people who know how to handle this.

<p>Alaska’s been through a lot, we’ve been through earthquakes, volcanoes, weather, colonialism—we’ve been through a lot of stuff!  The colonization initially brought in all this horrible disease for native communities to deal with. Now here we are in 2020, and these people know how to do what they need to do. We listened really early on to Anne Zink. I think the Federal government was missing a beat there. they weren’t able to model good behavior, or to figure out a way to insure that our providers here in this state got to the supplies that they needed. People felt a lot of anxiety around it, they were working out their own channels, even our own governor was figuring out how to get help from church groups, any strings we could pull to get it done, we pulled.

<p>There’s a recognition that the federal government missed a beat. Maybe they were being extremely hopeful that it would just go away. I don’t know the reasoning. But their lack of positive leadership created havoc that we will be enduring for generations, and we’ll remember it.

<p>In terms of Alaska, our Federal delegation was mixed. Our senators did what they needed to do as much as possible, they modeled behavior, they held a couple of virtual town halls. Our campaign had probably held 10 or 11 by then, but they came into the mix. 

<p>But Don Young, my opponent, our one Representative, was unfortunately not the leader that Alaska needed at that time. He flew on a plane 10 hours to Anchorage in mid-March, then went to a fundraiser, missed the vote on the first huge Federal stimulus bill, then went and met in a senior center with over 80 seniors, very recklessly shaking hands with everyone. He went up to the dais, gave a speech, and said this is a “beer virus” made up by fake media. “You should go on and continue with your everyday activity,” that’s what he said.

<p>Unfortunately, in that area, there have been cases, ones that led to severe illness and death. So I’m sad to say not only did he miss the vote, he also was not the model Alaskans deserve. Maybe even as importantly, he’s been unable to make sure our businesses receive support. There has been a trillion dollars in support allocated, but Alaskans have received the least of that per capita.  He also did not vote for an oversight committee, to hold the banks and everyone accountable to make sure the funds were dispensed fairly.

<p>Alaskans get it. They’re watching the lack of leadership and I think that may be part of what’s leading to our readiness for change.

<p><b>Young seems to take a relish in being contrarian almost for the sake of it. There’s an oppositional nature that in other contexts I understand can be charming or appealing, but when we really do need to band together, it makes your hair stand on end.</b></p> 

<p>Yeah—not in a pandemic! This is not the time! I think it is okay and fair to say we’re pretty authentic up here, and he is a character; that’s who he is. But you’ve gotta show up for your job. That’s where Alaskans draw the line. You can be a character all you want, but—seriously? 

<p>Two weeks ago he wouldn’t vote; he missed six out of six of the votes. And the reason is, he didn’t want to vote remotely. He’s that guy who’s proud to say he’s never opened a laptop, never texted. He’ll plant all kinds of seeds of fear and doubt about those things. It’s just time to move us into the future.

<p><b>You alluded to this a few minutes ago, but I wanted to ask in more detail about native communities and their response. We’ve seen a huge impact in the Navajo Nation; there’s a lot of fear about susceptibility and lack of care. You said that some communities were isolating almost on a community level. Can you speak a little bit more about that?</b></p>

<p>I think it would help you to understand why I’m running this differently from last time. While I’ve been in different villages throughout the state virtually, I would *never* go travel there right now, because it would be disrespectful. In the interior alone, there are more than forty communities without water or sewer, still.  Can you imagine hearing and reading online about COVID-19, and how the thing you need to do more than anything else is wash your hands, in that situation?  

<p>I think they’ve isolated to really protect themselves after the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918, like I mentioned. One of my team members on our staff is from Fort Yukon, and her grandmother passed away in that pandemic. It’s something that people seem to remember, it’s still fresh in their minds. There’s such a deep history there that we need to respect. I’ve been mindful about that. We start by asking if there’s any way we can help, we do a lot of wellness calls—thousands of those. Often the people that we call will then ask if they can volunteer to help us make more of these calls—that’s Alaskan!  It’s been amazing, maybe one in ten calls will be like that, where they want to volunteer to help us. 

<p>Especially in the first month or so, it was like that. A lot of Alaskans live alone, a lot of them live off the road system. A lot of them live off the grid, so they’re not connected to things the way others are. They might hear something on the radio. Sometimes they’ll get a little bit of internet, but it’s just not the same. So they’re living with a bit of anxiety, and living alone. It’s been really helpful for us just to be able to connect people with one another.

<p>In rural Alaska especially, I think it’s important that we respect their history and the ways that they want to be helped and communicated with. We've been listening to their communities, and their needs, rather than inserting ourselves into their world. So far it’s been very well received, and an honor to be able to connect with them that way.

<p><b>One thing that you’ve talked about in the past that’s stayed with me is the issue of domestic violence and abuse, which is something that everyone is facing as it’s being exacerbated by the pandemic. I happened to spend the first months of the pandemic in Japan, where people have tiny apartments, and suddenly were being asked to stay home 24/7. There’s a lot of stigma and shame in that society around domestic violence, but there was a clear uptick and spike in such cases. Is that something that’s been a concern in Alaska?</b></p>

<p>I’ll add some of what I know is going on. First of all, Alaska, well before all of this, had domestic violence and sexual assault rates well above the national average, probably top in all of those areas. What I know has happened for children, which gives me a bit of comfort, is that teachers — this is up until summer began— have been very intentional in reaching out to every family, especially families that they think may appreciate more support. They’ve made sure they have things like food, but you really can’t get into the home with a counselor the same way as before.

<p>This hits close to home for me. One thing that I am sharing more this time than last race is my experience.. I think that we need to help people appreciate the reality of it. 

<p>My family had a lot of these challenges, that come with addiction and mental health issues. I’ve shared with some that my first memory is of putting makeup on my mom, to hide the shame. My first memory. My first memory of a sound is of an arm being broken. 

<p>I’ve shared this now in combination with other, important pieces of my history. It took me a lot to get to this point. I decided in this race, if I’m really going to earn people’s trust, I’ve got to go to the real story.  My story is not unique; it’s not. But it is important for us to share our stories. For me, I had a girl scout leader who took me in, made me feel like I sold the most cookies in the whole state. I had church eight blocks the other way, there I learned the joy of music that I’ve never lost. 

<p>But more than anything else, it was public education. Every day when I walked into Government Hill elementary school, I was warmly welcomed, I was embraced, I was made to believe that I could do anything, and I think more importantly, I was given the skills to do that. 

<p>If we do that piece right, that’s available every day for children like me, and all of the other pieces of a community that come together. It gives me hope to know that, yes, our resilience is real. 

<p>But it’s important to know we have challenges. When we don’t have the right policies in place, then we’re not going to create that space where our youngest, when they need support, are getting it. Or our new families, or new parents—to know what to do, how to be a parent. 

<p>New parents, first of all, need to have a darned good job. If they don’t have that, then there’s stress in that home; there’s no question about it. If they can’t sustain themselves, if they need health care or mental health care, if they can’t have access to it—if they can’t have a house that’s safe, and if they don’t have that connection to a community that’s strong. All of those pieces are important. And I think you know me well enough to know that’s why I’m in this.

<p><b>So many people are out there for whom, when they had tough times in childhood, their memory is of a teacher. I didn’t have abuse in my childhood, but I was a lonely kid, I struggled with English, and I still remember teachers in second grade, fifth grade, seventh grade, who stopped me on the way out of a classroom. That’s a golden memory for so many people.</b></p>

<p>Man, oh man. I appreciate that so much. The idea that they made you feel every day that you’re going to be missed if you don’t show up tomorrow, right? You’re valued! Every child should have that. And our job as adults now is to look after that next generation, and after. How can we set it up for that to be there? How do we set it up for even fewer stresses at home? That’s on us. We’re the grown ups in the room.  We’re the grown ups just for everything to make sense to them. 

<p>Right now they’re looking up at the leadership—and is it any wonder that we see so few 18 year olds vote? Is it? No! We all understand why that is. They don’t trust that those who are making decisions around everything—health care, climate is a big one! What did they just learn in science class? Does any of our policy line up with that? That’s on us. 

<p>I appreciate that very much, so I’m becoming a bit more vulnerable in order to help people appreciate that I understand there are a lot of challenges out there. But I also understand our resilience. So I’m trying to help connect those dots. We’re going to do that by being honest and making sure we get out there with our stories

<p><b>A striking thing in rural areas of the lower 48 is how much health care is concentrating in towns. Especially for any sort of crisis care for mental health, people have to drive clear across the state to get to it. Rural providers are disappearing. I’m wondering if that’s a dynamic you’re seeing in Alaska as well, that healthcare is something you have to go to the city for.</b></p>

<p>Okay. Oh gosh, there’s a whole bunch on that one. As much as you’ve heard about what we’ve experience in Alaska with regard to the high rape rate, highest suicide rate between ages 18 and 25 in the nation (by many times!), domestic violence as well, all of these things. It makes sense that we would appreciate how important mental health care is up here. However, we have no real pipeline for psychiatrists in Alaska, we have very few opportunities to become a counselor. This is an area that I am very much looking forward to being a champion around, because it will have a lasting impact for the health and economic health of our communities. Once we can expand easy access, the effect will be vast. 

<p>I have many friends who are middle class Alaskans, and if their teenager is experiencing any kind of anxiety, or maybe even suicidal ideas, all of these things that seem very important to a parent—it can be up to five or six weeks before you can get care. Your other choice is the ER, where they will spend a few minutes making sure you’ll live through the night, then send you home and say ‘we’ll try to find someone’.  And then once again, you're stuck in that cycle for another five weeks. 

<p>But what if three nights from now it becomes more serious? The parent doesn’t really know how to navigate all that. So there’s a desperate need—and I don’t think it’s just for Alaska, but I can tell you here we’re experiencing it at a higher rate—we especially need to have some more attention on this, and it’s hurting us. We are a state that deserves better.

<p>I will add that with the pandemic, we’ve been able to experience more online opportunities and get used to that in ways that may become helpful. But I will also add what I’m hearing from psychiatrists and psychologists is that there are often times richer experiences if you can see some of the non-verbal cues that aren’t necessarily available on a Zoom conference call like we’re having. 

<p>It’s a great question that you ask, and we have a lot of work to do. There is something called the Violence Against Women Act that is sitting in the Senate right now waiting to pass, we can get into a lot of weeds with this. Nonprofits in Alaska and throughout the nation are typically on grant cycles that don’t allow for long-term planning.

<p><i>At this point, our time ran out, as Alyse had to continue on an endless round of Zoom calls.</i></p>

				<div class="description">David Heinemeier Hansson: We celebrated too soon with getting Apple&#8217;s approval for HEY in the App Store. Yes, v1.0 was approved, but now we&#8217;ve been denied our v1.0.1 update, which has important bug fixes, because we don&#8217;t do IAP. It&#8217;s really sad that Apple has such a capricious and inconsistent review process. What&#8217;s OK one [&#8230;]</div>
