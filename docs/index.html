This is Ridgeline newsletter on walking in Japan and I’m Craig Mod, and we’re in the middle of making a book.
I believe the book now has a &ldquo;real&rdquo; name — Kissa by Kissa. For as much as it&rsquo;s about pizza toast, the binding agents and stars of the book are the kissaten that dot the 1,000 km walk. Maybe there will be a subtitle with &ldquo;toast&rdquo; in it (or maybe not), but for the last ten days I&rsquo;ve been operating under Kissa by Kissa and it feels pretty good.</div>
