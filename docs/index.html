I’ve been thinking about this question for a while, but more so in this past week for obvious reasons.

I don’t make it a point to be doing so, it&rsquo;s just a nice time to be out and about, so I often am. And it&rsquo;s also an easy day to remember in Japan — kodomo no hi or Kids Day. The colorful koinobori are flying, climbing. Last year and the year before and the year before that and even the year before that, on May 5th I was somewhere out in the countryside of Japan, pack on my back, blue skies, with those flopping carp hoisted up above the homes and rivers waving in the wind.</div>

				<div class="description">Yet-still-sheltered but wanna-be-walking folk — My friends made a wonderful printed thing. It’s called NJP#1: Shōwa Tokyo and it offers you a glimpse into Tokyo circa 1926 - 1989. A big chunk of what emerged in that period is, obviously, still part of the city. So to spend time in Shōwa is to better understand Tokyo today.
The printed thing vibrates between magazine and book — it’s vaguely magazine shaped, but the driving ethos is firmly book-leaning.</div>
