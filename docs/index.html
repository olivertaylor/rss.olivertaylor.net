This new iPad Magic Keyboard trackpad doesn&rsquo;t employ the taptic engine of Apple&rsquo;s other trackpads, it&rsquo;s just a good ’ole mechanical click that works evenly across the entire surface (there is no perceivable difference between clicking at the top or bottom, center, far left or far right).</p></li>
